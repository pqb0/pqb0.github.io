                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p class="extra-text">
                    I am a recent IB graduate with a strong foundation in Abstract Algebra, Real Analysis, and mathematical logic. 
                    Currently, I am advancing my knowledge in mathematics while honing my programming skills in Python and C++. 
                    I am committed to continuous learning and applying my skills practically. 
                    <br>
                    I developed an invastigation which explores the conditions under which \( \cos(\theta) \) is a constructible
                    number, using Field Theory and Galois Theory. It delves into Euclidean constructions, algebraic structures,
                    field extensions, and cyclotomic polynomials to determine for which values of \( \theta \), specifically
                    \( \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right) \), construction by compass and straightedge is possible.
                    <br>
                    I also analyzed the dynamics of the predator-prey model using differential equations, exploring equilibrium
                    stability, oscillatory behavior, and real-world applications in population dynamics.
                    <br>
                    I explored RSA encryption using group theory, focusing on the Carmichael function and the multiplicative group
                    of integers modulo N to analyze the encryption structure and its security. Using a cyclic operator and finding
                    an expression for the open key in terms of the closd key.

                    The Math Journal is a structured repository of mathematical insights, definitions, proofs,
                    and examples designed to document and explore key concepts in advanced mathematics. It 
                    serves as a dynamic resource for both learning and reference, emphasizing clarity, precision,
                    and the logical progression of ideas.

                    I will also include Physics at some point.
